# eBay Scraper with GUI

This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to scrape sold listings from eBay. It allows you to:

* Enter a search keyword for items you want to track.
* Filter results by listing type (All, Best Offer, Auction, Buy It Now).
* Set minimum/maximum price range and time filters.
* Easily export the scraped data into a CSV file named after your keyword.

## Features

* **User-Friendly GUI:** A simple interface makes it easy to input your search criteria.
* **Customizable Filters:**  Refine your search based on price, listing type, and time frame.
* **Data Export:**  Save results in a convenient CSV format for further analysis.
* **Error Logging:**  Logs any errors that occur during scraping to `error_log.txt`.
